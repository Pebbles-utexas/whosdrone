# Whoscifer Drone
Final project for AET346C Video Game Modding, Skyrat-tg Custom Ghost Role

This custom ghost role for the Space Station 13 codebase Skyrat-tg was made for my use on a private server with friends. I am not terribly fond of the complete reset nature of the game's round-based gameplay loop. This playable drone is intentionally overpowered and overgeared simply because it is fun to mess around with. Chaos abound! 

# Installation
First, go to the [byond](https://www.byond.com/?) website, create an account, and download the game engine. Windows may try to prevent the installation due to the old nature of the game, but you can simply click More Info and then Run Anyway to continue the installation.

Next, for simplicity, I have made a BAT script that will only work on Windows machines. This BAT file will download the Skyrat-tg codebase, my files, and put them together to create the executable needed to run the game. Either download and run the full installer or you can run each step of the installer labelled with 1, 2, and 3. Be sure to copy the path to the executable it provides after finishes building the game.

For the full installer, right click [this](https://github.com/Pebbles-utexas/whosdrone/raw/main/WhosDrone%20-%20Full%20Installer.bat) link and choose Save Link As

# Running the game
Open the Dream Daemon application installed alongside the byond launcher. Dream Daemon allows the running of servers using the executable created during the installation process. To the left of the green Go button is a text box that you can place the executable path into. From there press Go, wait for the server to fully initialize after you accept the final pop-up. 
To finally join the game look to the top of the Dream Daemon window where it says | File | World | Help | and click World then find the Join option in the list that appears under it.

The round will start after a timer ends and you can select the Observe option which will spawn you as a ghost. As a ghost you will see a bar of options in the bottom center. The leftmost option is a skeleton called the Spawner Menu, click that and scroll to the bottom of the window where you will see the Whoscifer Drone. Click the spawn option to play as the drone I made.

You can select a drone sprite to use for cosmetic reasons and start playing.

WASD to move, Middle Click to teleport
The computer terminal in the bottom center hotbar can be opened with right click to see the items that come built into the drone.
It contains more terminal icons which can be opened with right click as well.
