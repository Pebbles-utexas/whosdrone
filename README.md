# Whoscifer Drone
Final project for AET346C Video Game Modding, Skyrat-tg Custom Ghost Role

This custom ghost role for the Space Station 13 codebase Skyrat-tg was made for my use on a private server with friends. I am not terribly fond of the complete reset nature of the game's round-based gameplay loop. This playable drone is intentionally overpowered and overgeared simply because it is fun to mess around with. Chaos abound! 

# Installation
First, go to the [byond](https://www.byond.com/?) website, create an account, and download the game engine. Windows may try to prevent the installation due to the old nature of the game, but you can simply click More Info and then Run Anyway to continue the installation.

Next, for simplicity, I have made a BAT script that will only work on Windows machines. This BAT file will download the Skyrat-tg codebase, my files, and put them together to create the executable needed to run the game. Either follow the instructions in the pdf file or simply download WhosDrone.bat by itself and run it. Be sure to copy the path to the executable it provides after finishing.
